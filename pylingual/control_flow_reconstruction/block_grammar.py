"""
The block structure Python accepts, as a pushdown automaton over skeletons in source order (see skeleton.py).

Every skeleton the automaton accepts renders (templates/Skeleton.py) to source that compiles, as long as each statement
line is valid on its own and the statements fit together (`consistent`). It checks that:
    - header statements open a block and other statements do not; a while header comes after LOOP, so every
      structure has one spelling
    - clauses follow the block they continue: else, except / except*, finally, case
    - a try has an except or finally, a bare except and an irrefutable case come last, except and except* do not mix
    - break / continue are in a loop and not in an except* block, and continue is not in a finally block before 3.8
    - return is not in an except* block
    - decorators come right before a definition, docstrings and `from __future__` imports come first
    - nesting stays under CPython's limits
Empty blocks are fine: SourceContext writes `pass` in them. tests/test_block_grammar.py and tests/test_cflow_dataset.py
compile random accepted skeletons with every version.

From every state the automaton reaches the skeleton can still be finished (`complete`), so a decoder that only takes
allowed tokens never gets stuck.
