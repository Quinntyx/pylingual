"""
Bytecode -> control flow model input.

A code object is split into statements, one per line start. Each statement is written as its kind (from the translated
line), its control flow opcodes and the edges that leave it, with targets as statement references:

    | <s1> K_for GET_ITER FOR_ITER f+ <s3> ~

Tokens:
    |           starts a statement, followed by its reference <sN> and its kind
    K_...       kind of the translated line (see `line_kind`); K_none for a keyword line its bytecode cannot be
    OPNAME      an opcode in CONTROL_OPS or a jump; a repeat in a row is written once. COMPARE_OP_EXC is an
                exception match (<= 3.8)
    n j t f     natural, jump, true and false edge to another statement, followed by its reference
    x           the exception handler changes to the statement that follows; x0: exceptions are no longer caught
    + - =       edge direction, appended to the edge letter: to a later, earlier or the same statement
    ~           after a reference: the edge lands inside that statement, not at its start
    @           code inside the statement that is not reached by falling through (merged handler code)
    nf          the statement never falls through to the next one
Edges to the next instruction and within a statement are implied, so are not written.

Trained models expect exactly this encoding: any change to the output here needs new models.
